cd fibonacci-rust
```

## Usage

To generate the Fibonacci sequence, run the following command:

```bash
cargo run
```

This will compile and run the program, generating the Fibonacci sequence.

### Example Output

```
Fibonacci Sequence:
Iteration 1: 0
Iteration 2: 1
Iteration 3: 1
Iteration 4: 2
Iteration 5: 3
Iteration 6: 5
Iteration 7: 8
Iteration 8: 13
Iteration 9: 21
...
```

You can modify ```max_iterations``` to change the number of terms generated in the sequence by editing the source code.
